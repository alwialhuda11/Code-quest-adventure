# Code Quest Adventure

Welcome to Code Quest Adventure! This is a text-based adventure game designed to help you learn basic programming concepts through solving puzzles. Each correct solution earns you points, and your progress is tracked throughout the game.

## How to Play

1. **Clone or Download the Repository:**
   If you haven't already, clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. **Install Python:**
   Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

3. **Open the Project in Visual Studio Code (VSCode):**
   - Open VSCode.
   - Click on `File` > `Open Folder...` and select the folder where you saved the game files.

4. **Install Python Extension for VSCode:**
   Open VSCode and install the Python extension by Microsoft. You can do this by clicking on the Extensions icon on the sidebar (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X`), then search for "Python" and install the extension provided by Microsoft.

5. **Run the Game:**
   - Open the integrated terminal in VSCode by clicking on `View` > `Terminal` or press `` Ctrl+` ``.
   - Ensure you're in the directory where your Python file is saved. You can navigate using the `cd` command.
   - Run the Python script by typing:
     ```sh
     python code_quest_adventure.py
     ```

## Game Scenarios

The game consists of several scenarios, each focusing on a different programming concept:

1. **Basic Arithmetic**
2. **String Manipulation**
3. **Looping Constructs**
4. **Conditional Statements**
5. **Functions**
6. **Lists**
7. **Dictionaries**
8. **File Operations**
9. **Exception Handling**

Each scenario presents a puzzle that you need to solve by entering a code snippet. Your solution is evaluated, and you receive feedback along with points for correct solutions.

## Scoring System

You earn points for each correct solution:

- Basic Arithmetic: 10 points
- String Manipulation: 10 points
- Looping Constructs: 10 points
- Conditional Statements: 10 points
- Functions: 20 points
- Lists: 20 points
- Dictionaries: 20 points
- File Operations: 30 points
- Exception Handling: 30 points

Your total score is displayed at the end of the game.

## Example

Here's an example of how to solve the first scenario:

```plaintext
Scenario 1: Basic Arithmetic
Solve: What is 2 + 2?
Enter your solution: 2 + 2
Correct! Well done. You earned 10 points.
